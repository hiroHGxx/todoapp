# Simple ToDo App

This is a minimal to-do list built with plain HTML and JavaScript. Open
`index.html` in your browser to add and remove tasks. The list uses your
browser's localStorage so tasks remain even after refreshing the page.

## Development

Install dependencies and run the tests with:

```bash
npm install
npm test
```
